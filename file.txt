JavaScript has evolved significantly since its inception, and one of its major milestones was 
the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. ES6 brought a plethora of new features 
and syntactical improvements to the language, making it more powerful and easier to 
work with. Some notable features include let and const for variable declarations, arrow
functions for concise function syntax, classes for object-oriented programming, template
literals for easier string manipulation, and promises for better asynchronous programming. 
Additionally, Node.js, a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web 
browser, has leveraged JavaScript's capabilities, enabling developers to build scalable and 
efficient web applications. This synergy between ES6 and Node.js has significantly 
influenced the development of modern web applications, demonstrating JavaScript's 
flexibility and robustness as a programmingÂ language.
